Most of the week is focused on getting up to speed with fundamentals, I already worked on most of the topics/concepts before and now I would like to train on diff data/tasks, read seminal papers [ilya u30](https://arc.net/folder/D0472A20-9C20-4D3F-B145-D2865C0A9FEE)

starting with small language models and various vision tasks (fastdotai finetuing tasks), working on assignments from CS336.

GPU Poor :( how do I fix it?

Language models, AdamW, Learning rate, Tokenization, LayerNorm, BatchNorm, Dropout, Residual Connection, Backprop.

Arch: Transformer, Mixture of Experts, ResNet

how do I get the job as a research engineer or build my own product.. what type of product, should I focus on application layer or put more focus on research. 

things to read: AlphaGoZero
